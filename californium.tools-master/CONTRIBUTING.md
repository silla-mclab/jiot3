First of all, thanks for considering to contribute to Eclipse Californium. We really appreciate the time and effort you want to

Here is a (non-exclusive, non-prioritized) list of things you might be able to help us with:

* improvements regarding code quality e.g. improving readability, performance, modularity etc.

In order to get you started as fast as possible we need to go through some organizational issues first, though.
